    "# Working with CSV Files and CSV Module\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file is like a plain text table that holds data with commas between the values. Unlike Excel files, CSV files are very basic. They don't have special formatting like fonts or colors, and all their data is treated as simple text. CSV files also don't have multiple sheets like Excel does. If you want to work with Excel files using Python, there are some libraries you can explore http://www.python-excel.org/ and https://www.xlwings.org/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files is a common task in data processing and analysis. CSV files are plain text files that store tabular data with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. Python provides the `csv` module to make it easy to read from and write to CSV files.\n",

    "## Reading from a CSV File\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a CSV file named \"data.csv\" with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "Name,Age\n",
    "Saurabh,21\n",
    "Dinesh,23\n",
    "Rishi,32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read this file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"data.csv\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "    for row in csv_reader:\n",
    "        print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['Name', 'Age']\n",
    "['Saurabh', '21']\n",
    "['Dinesh', '23']\n",
    "['Rishi', '32']\n",
    "```\n",
